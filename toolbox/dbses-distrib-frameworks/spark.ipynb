    "\n",
    "Apache Spark is a general purpose open source distributed system for cluster computing  on large datasets. It is natively written in Scala but has API's for other languages. It was originally developed at the University  of California at Berkeley in 2009 and then donated to the [Apache Foundation](https://www.apache.org). \n",
    "\n",

    "The figure above illustrates in a very rough way what the Apache Spark environment consists of. Spark ML and MLlib are the libraries for Machine Learning: the first, newer, works with DataFrames; the second with RDDs (*Resilient Distributed Datasets*, see below). API's exist in Scala (Spark native language), Java, R and Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concepts illustrated briefly here in this note are reworked from the [[1]](#1), which is full of great material, including tutorials. "

    "## Distributed Data Model: RDDs and DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of the  computation in Spark lies in the use of RDDs (*Resilient Distributed Datasets*). An RDD is a partitioned collection of elements that can be operated in parallel; it is recomputed on node failures  and is created by the so-called *SparkContext* from input sources (local file system, [the HDFS](hadoop.ipynb#The-HDFS), ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "RDDs have these features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* are immutable once constructed;\n",
    "* enable operators to run in parallel;\n",
    "* are able to track info to recompute potential lost data;\n",
    "* the more the partitions, the more parallelism\n",
    "* are lazily evaluated\n",
    "\n",
    "A (distributed) DataFrame can be built from an RDD and is conceptually  similar to the corresponding R and Pandas ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that RDDs are lazily evaluated means that no operation is actually executed until an *action* is called, and this allows to skip intermediate big results. "

    "The *SparkContext* tells Spark how and where to access the cluster and is used to create the RDDs. Its *master* parameter sets the type and size of the cluster:\n",
