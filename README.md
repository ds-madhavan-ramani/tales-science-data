# Tales of Science & Data

> A semi-serious collection of notes on Data Science, Machine Learning and related stuff.


## Some meta
 
What exactly is this? Why did I even bother doing this? How did I choose to do this?

* The [**about**](about.md) gives a (sorta) detailed explanation from conception till realisation, and the structure and choices;
* The [**adminy**](adminy.md) documents the folders which are supporting material;
* The [**resources file**](resources.md) lists some data science material which I find brilliant and goes cross-topics, note that references to the single topics are listed in the respective notebooks instead.

Following here is the table of contents with links pointing to the chapters, where you can then proceed to the single topics.


## [Probability, Statistics and Data Analysis](prob-stats-data-analysis/README.md)

*Statistics is at the core of data science, and thourough data analysis is typically the starting point of any modelling effort on data.*
